Here’s an updated GitHub description that includes specific security protocols used by the **Bank Fraud Prevention System** for fraud detection:

---

# 🛡️ Bank Fraud Prevention System

A standalone Python application that leverages advanced security protocols to detect and prevent financial crime. This system uses file-based tracking to analyze transactions and identify anomalies, making it ideal for environments without a full database infrastructure. The system supports protocols such as transaction limits, time and location checks, and amount anomaly detection to safeguard financial data.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Bank Fraud Prevention System** is designed to enhance financial security by identifying unusual patterns across multiple factors. The application monitors transaction behavior, such as transaction amounts, frequency, timing, and location, to flag suspicious activities. With a lightweight `.db` file structure, it offers a simple yet effective solution for fraud detection.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔍 Protocol-Based Fraud Detection**  
  Employs several advanced protocols, including:
  - **Transaction Limits**: Detects transactions that exceed predefined thresholds.
  - **Bank Transaction Time**: Flags transactions occurring outside typical banking hours.
  - **Transaction Location**: Monitors for transactions from unexpected or unusual locations.
  - **Transaction Amount Anomaly**: Identifies sudden or suspicious changes in transaction amounts.

- **🛑 Comprehensive Fraud Mitigation**  
  Combines multiple checks to help prevent financial crimes and ensure transaction security.

- **📊 Lightweight Reporting**  
  Generates reports of flagged transactions for easy review and auditing.

- **🔐 Local Data Handling**  
  Uses Python’s file-based handling to maintain data integrity and privacy without requiring a full database setup.

- **📁 Simple Deployment & Maintenance**  
  Ideal for smaller-scale applications or environments where a full-scale database is unnecessary.

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. **File Database Setup**: The system uses a `.db` file located in the project directory to store transaction data. You can customize the file location in the configuration settings.
2. **Transaction Import**: Prepare transaction files in the specified format (e.g., CSV or JSON) and place them in the designated folder for tracking.
3. **Protocol Configuration**: Adjust the thresholds for each fraud detection protocol in `config.py`, such as:
   - Maximum transaction limit
   - Permitted transaction times
   - Approved transaction locations
   - Anomaly thresholds for transaction amounts

---

## 🛠 Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Start the fraud prevention system:
   ```bash
   python processor.py
   ```
2. **Monitor Activity**: The system will track and analyze transactions in `.db` files based on the defined protocols.
3. **Review Alerts**: Check the output log or report files for flagged activities and security alerts.
